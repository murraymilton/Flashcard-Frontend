// We want to keep track of our values . Our callback function is passed into our hook and is called whenerver the form is submitted

/*Weâ€™re setting up one state variable and one setter function called values and setValues.
Then we create a function called handleSubmit which takes an event. It prevents the default action of that event (refreshing the page after the event has been called). Afterwards, it just calls callback();
We create a function called handleChange which also takes an event.
Finally, we return handleChange, handleSubmit and values from the custom Hook so our component has access to them. */
